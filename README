Recommender systems are essential for enhancing
user experience and information filtering on a range of online
platforms. This work mostly explores collaborative filtering
approaches with an emphasis on the use of Alternating Least
Squares (ALS) matrix factorization for personalized movie recommendations using Apache Spark ML. The system provides
personalized movie recommendations for each user through using
ALS to forecast their tastes and a dataset that was obtained
from the Grouplens website. Two significant recommender system
approaches, Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative
Filtering (CF), will be discussed in this paper along with the
benefits and drawbacks of each.The collaborative filtering approach used in this study shows how successful it is in capturing
user preferences based on previous usage and getting outside
barriers like the cold-start issue. The recommendation made by
the recommendForAllUsers method The results show the way
the model could get used in practice by showcasing the system’s
ability to present personalized movie recommendations.
In this study, three key datasets are employed: ’Ratings,’
’movies,’ and ’users.’ The ’Ratings’ dataset encompasses
approximately 1 million ratings, featuring userId, movieId,
rating, and timestamp. The ’movies’ dataset contains essential
information on around 4000 movies, including movieId, title,
and genres
